        Aksum is a city in northern Ethiopia. It's
        known for its tall, carved obelisks, relics
        of the ancient Kingdom of Aksum. Most are in the northern
        Stelae Park, including a huge fallen pillar,
        now in pieces.Centuries-oldSt. Mary of Zion
        is a Christian church and pilgrimagesite
        believed to havehoused the biblical Ark of
        the Covenant. The neighboring Chapel of the
        Tablet is said to contain the Ark today.
        Aksum (also spelt Axum) stands at the epicentre of
        Ethiopian history. In ancient times, it served as the economic
        hub of the Aksumite Empire, which lasted for some nine hundred
        years from the second to the tenth centuries, and as the
        capital of a ruling dynasty legendarily descended from King
        Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. It is also the cradle and
        spiritual home of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, which was
        established here during the fourth-century reign of King Ezana.
        Somewhat more tenuous is the Ethiopian claim that the
        original biblical Ark of the Covenant is protected in Maryam
        Tsion, Aksumâ€™s most venerable church.

        Axum was the hub of the marine trading power known as the Aksumite Empire, which predated the earliest mentions
        in Roman-era writings. Around 356 CE,
        its ruler was converted to an Abyssinian variety of Christianity by Frumentius. Later, under the reign of the
        Emperor Kaleb, Axum was a quasi-ally of Byzantium against the Sasanian Empire which had adopted Zoroastrianism.
        The historical record is unclear with ancient church records being the primary contemporary sources.
        Aksum is studded with
        some extraordinary antiquities, including the tallest <b>stelae</b>
        (obelisks) ever erected by the ancients, and engraved
        trilingual tablets dating to the time of Christ all of
        which can behugely rewarding when approached with realistic
        expectations.
        It is believed the empire began a long and slow decline after the 7th century due partly to the Persians and
        then the Arabs contesting old Red Sea trade routes. Eventually the empire was cut off from its principal markets
        in Alexandria, Byzantium and Southern Europe and its share of trade captured by Arab traders of the era.

        The Axumite Empire showing its relation to other polities in 565
        The Aksumite Empire was finally destroyed in the 10th century by Empress Gudit,[5] and eventually some of the
        people of Axum were forced south and their old way of life declined. As the empire's power declined so did the
        influence of the city, which is believed to have lost population in the decline, similar to Rome and other
        cities thrust away from the flow of world events.
        The last known (nominal) emperor to reign was crowned in about the 10th century, but the empire's influence and
        power had ended long before that.
